## Out of Scope

| E-commerce / payments | No paid products at launch |
| User accounts / login | Not needed until courses are live |
| Blog / content marketing | Not part of v1, adds maintenance burden |
| Live workshop / events page | Deferred, not in initial scope |
| CRM / email automation | Just capture emails, automation handled externally |
| Chatbot / live chat | Premature for a site with no traffic yet |
| Social media feed integration | Adds third-party dependencies and clutter |
