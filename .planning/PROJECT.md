# Elevateo Co

## What This Is

A business education website for Elevateo Co, teaching established business owners how to scale their businesses. Built around founder Alan Chan as the visible authority figure, with a dark and bold visual identity inspired by acquisition.com. The site launches with full page structure and email lead capture, with video course content to follow.

## Core Value

Established business owners land on the site, immediately see Elevateo Co as a credible authority on scaling, and sign up to stay connected.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Home page with bold hero section, credibility indicators, and clear CTA
- [ ] About page showcasing Alan Chan's story, credentials, and founder presence
- [ ] Courses page with grid layout and placeholder slots for upcoming video courses
- [ ] Email signup for updates (newsletter-style lead capture) across all pages
- [ ] Dark & bold visual design — dark backgrounds, strong typography, authority feel
- [ ] Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Full site navigation between Home, About, and Courses pages

### Out of Scope

- Video course content / hosting — content doesn't exist yet, structure only
- E-commerce / payments — no paid products at launch
- User accounts / login — not needed until courses are live
- Blog / content marketing — not part of v1
- Live workshop / events page — deferred, not in initial scope
- CRM / email automation — just capture emails, automation handled externally

## Context

- Inspired by acquisition.com — dark, bold, authority-driven design
- Hybrid brand: Elevateo Co is the company, Alan Chan is the visible founder
- Target audience: established business owners already generating revenue, looking to scale past $500k-$1M+
- Content strategy: website launches first as lead capture + brand presence, video courses added over time
- General business scaling focus — offers, leads, sales, operations (broad like Hormozi)

## Constraints

- **Content**: No video courses exist yet — course page needs placeholder structure that looks intentional, not empty
- **Design**: Must match dark & bold aesthetic similar to acquisition.com — this is non-negotiable for brand positioning

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dark & bold design over clean/minimal | Matches authority positioning and acquisition.com inspiration | — Pending |
| Hybrid brand (company + founder) | Elevateo Co as entity, Alan Chan as the face — balances personal trust with company scale | — Pending |
| Full structure at launch (not just landing page) | Site needs to look established and ready even before courses drop | — Pending |
| Email signup over lead magnet | Simpler to launch, captures interest without needing to create a free resource first | — Pending |
