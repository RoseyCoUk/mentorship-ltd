<objective>
Create the three page shells (Home, About, Courses) with meaningful placeholder content using the shared components, then verify responsive behavior across all breakpoints. After this plan, the site skeleton is complete and ready for real content in Phases 2-4.

Purpose: The page shells prove the foundation works end-to-end: layout, navigation, components, and responsiveness all functioning together across multiple pages.
Output: Three navigable pages with placeholder content, verified responsive at mobile/tablet/desktop.

  </files>
  <action>
    Replace the component test page with real page shells. Each page imports Base layout and shared components to demonstrate the foundation works.

    1. Create src/pages/index.astro (Home):

       Import Base layout, SectionWrapper, Button, and Card components.

       Sections (all placeholder content -- real content comes in Phase 2):

       a. Hero section: Full-width with extra vertical padding.
          - Headline: `text-hero font-bold text-white` -- "Scale Your Business Past $1M" (placeholder)
          - Subheadline: `text-body-lg text-text-secondary` -- 1-2 sentences about helping established owners
          - Two buttons: Primary "Get Started" and Secondary "Learn More"
          - Center-aligned text on mobile, left-aligned on desktop (md:text-left)

       b. Problem/Solution section: Using SectionWrapper width="wide"
          - Section heading: `text-h2` -- "The Scaling Challenge" (placeholder)
          - 3 Cards in a responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`)
          - Each card with a placeholder title and 1-2 lines of text
          - This section will be rebuilt in Phase 2 with real content

       c. CTA section: Using SectionWrapper width="narrow", center-aligned
          - Heading: `text-h2` -- "Ready to Scale?" (placeholder)
          - Brief paragraph in text-text-secondary
          - Primary Button CTA

       Page meta: `title="Home"`, `description="Elevateo Co helps established business owners scale past $1M."`

    2. Create src/pages/about.astro (About):

       Import Base layout, SectionWrapper, Button, and Card components.

       Sections (all placeholder -- real content in Phase 3):

       a. Hero section:
          - Heading: `text-h1` -- "About Elevateo Co" or "Meet the Founder"
          - Subtext: `text-body-lg text-text-secondary` -- 1-2 sentences

       b. Founder section: Using SectionWrapper width="wide"
          - Two-column layout on desktop (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8)
          - Left: Placeholder for photo (a dark card-like box with text "Photo Coming Soon" -- NOT an actual image)
          - Right: Placeholder text about the founder's story (2-3 paragraphs of lorem-like business text)

       c. Philosophy section: Using SectionWrapper width="narrow"
          - Heading: `text-h2` -- "Our Philosophy" or "What Makes Us Different"
          - 2-3 short paragraphs of placeholder text in text-text-secondary

       Page meta: `title="About"`, `description="Learn about Alan Chan and the Elevateo Co mission to help business owners scale."`

    3. Create src/pages/courses.astro (Courses):

       Import Base layout, SectionWrapper, Button, and Card components.

       Sections (all placeholder -- real content in Phase 4):

       a. Hero section:
          - Heading: `text-h1` -- "Courses" or "Learn to Scale"
          - Subtext: `text-body-lg text-text-secondary` -- "Expert-led courses on scaling your business. Coming soon."

       b. Course grid section: Using SectionWrapper width="wide"
          - 3-4 Cards in a responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`)
          - Each card represents a placeholder course:
            - Card title (text-h3, white)
            - Card description (text-text-secondary, 1-2 lines)
            - A "Coming Soon" badge (small inline element with bg-navy-700, text-accent, rounded-full, px-3 py-1, text-xs, uppercase, font-bold)
          - Placeholder course topics: "Scaling Operations", "Lead Generation Mastery", "Sales Systems", and optionally "Offer Creation"

       c. Notification section: Using SectionWrapper width="narrow", center-aligned
          - Heading: `text-h2` -- "Get Notified When We Launch"
          - FormInput component with placeholder "Enter your email" (visual only, no submission logic)
          - Primary Button "Notify Me"
          - Wrap input + button in a flex container: `flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4`

       Page meta: `title="Courses"`, `description="Expert-led business scaling courses from Elevateo Co. Coming soon."`

    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - All content is placeholder. Do NOT write final copy. Use realistic-sounding placeholder text that shows the structure.
    - Each page MUST use the Base layout wrapper (`<Base title="...">content</Base>`)
    - Use the shared components (SectionWrapper, Button, Card, FormInput) -- do NOT inline styles that components already handle
    - Ensure trailing slashes on nav links match: Home is "/", About is "/about/", Courses is "/courses/"
    - Astro routes: about.astro serves at /about/, courses.astro serves at /courses/ (with trailingSlash default behavior)

    Run `pnpm dev` and verify:
    1. Home page loads at localhost:4321/ with hero, cards grid, and CTA sections
    2. About page loads at localhost:4321/about/ with hero, two-column founder section, and philosophy
    3. Courses page loads at localhost:4321/courses/ with hero, course card grid, and notification section
    4. Clicking "Home" in nav goes to /, "About" goes to /about/, "Courses" goes to /courses/
    5. Active nav link changes color (gold) on each page
    6. All pages use SectionWrapper, Button, Card, FormInput components (no raw unstyled HTML)
    Run `pnpm build` to confirm all pages build successfully.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Three page shells exist with structured placeholder content, all using the Base layout and shared components. Navigation between all pages works. Each page has distinct sections that will be filled with real content in later phases.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 1 foundation: Astro project with Tailwind v4, dark navy design token system, Inter Variable font, six shared components (Header, Footer, Button, Card, SectionWrapper, FormInput), responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu, and three page shells (Home, About, Courses) with placeholder content.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    The dev server should already be running from Task 1. If not, run `pnpm dev` in the project directory.

    **Desktop verification (resize browser to 1440px+ wide):**
    1. Visit http://localhost:4321/ -- confirm dark navy background, gold accent elements, Inter font
    2. Check header: logo on left, "Home | About | Courses | Get Started" links visible
    3. Confirm "Home" link is highlighted in gold
    4. Click "About" in nav -- page changes, "About" link turns gold
    5. Click "Courses" in nav -- page changes, "Courses" link turns gold
    6. Click "Home" to return -- confirm all navigation round-trips work
    7. Verify footer is at bottom of each page with nav links and copyright

    **Tablet verification (resize to ~768px):**
    8. Confirm navigation is still desktop-style (inline links, not hamburger)
    9. Confirm content reflows (cards may stack to 2 columns)

    **Mobile verification (resize to 375px or use DevTools mobile mode):**
    10. Confirm hamburger icon replaces nav links
    11. Click hamburger -- menu panel opens with all page links
    12. Confirm background does NOT scroll when menu is open
    13. Press Escape key -- menu closes
    14. Navigate to About and Courses via mobile menu -- confirm it works on all pages

    **Component check:**
    15. Verify buttons appear in different styles (gold primary, dark secondary)
    16. Verify cards have visible borders against the dark background
    17. On Courses page, verify email input has visible border and gold focus ring when clicked
    18. Verify no horizontal scrollbar appears at any viewport width
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the foundation looks correct, or describe any issues you see (layout breaks, missing elements, wrong colors, navigation problems).</resume-signal>

7. At 1440px: content is constrained to max-width, centered, with no stretched elements
8. Shared components (Button, Card, SectionWrapper, FormInput) are used on page shells -- not raw inline HTML
9. `pnpm build` succeeds for all pages
10. Footer appears at bottom of every page
