<objective>
Add the FAQ accordion section and email signup form to the home page, completing all four requirements (HOME-01 through HOME-04).

Purpose: The FAQ section addresses common objections that prevent signups (trust building). The email signup section is the primary conversion goal of the entire page -- the visitor's journey from hero to signup must end with a clear, functional form. Together these complete the home page's PAS framework: Problem (cards) -> Agitation (solution reframe) -> Solution (FAQ removes doubt) -> Action (email signup).

Output: index.astro updated with FAQ and email signup sections. The home page is complete.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add FAQ section and email signup section to index.astro</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
Open src/pages/index.astro and replace the Plan 02 comment placeholders with the FAQ and email signup sections. AccordionItem and FormInput are already imported (Plan 01 added them). Do NOT modify the hero, problem, or solution sections above.

**Section 4: FAQ (on default navy-900 body background)**
- SectionWrapper with width="narrow"
- h2 text-h2 text-center mb-10 "Frequently Asked Questions"
- Wrapper div (no extra classes needed -- AccordionItem has its own border-b)
- 6 AccordionItem instances with these questions and answers:

1. question="Who is Elevateo for?"
   Answer p: "Elevateo is built for established business owners already generating revenue who want to scale past $500K-$1M+. If you are just getting started, this is not the right fit -- we focus on scaling systems, not startup tactics."

2. question="How is this different from other business coaching?"
   Answer p: "Most coaching is generic motivation or theory. Elevateo provides specific, proven frameworks for operational scaling -- the systems, team structures, and processes that actually move the needle past seven figures."

3. question="Do I need to be at a certain revenue level?"
   Answer p: "Our frameworks are designed for businesses generating at least $250K+ in annual revenue. At this stage, you have product-market fit and need to focus on systems, teams, and scalable operations -- which is exactly what we teach."

4. question="What kind of results can I expect?"
   Answer p: "Results vary by business, but our frameworks focus on three outcomes: removing yourself as the bottleneck, building repeatable revenue systems, and creating operational clarity. Most owners see meaningful progress within 90 days of implementation."

5. question="Is this a course, coaching, or community?"
   Answer p: "Elevateo is building a library of focused video courses on specific scaling challenges. Each course is designed to be actionable -- not theory you will never use. Coaching and community may be added in the future based on demand."

6. question="What if this does not work for my industry?"
   Answer p: "The frameworks we teach are industry-agnostic. Whether you run a service business, e-commerce store, or SaaS product, the fundamentals of scaling -- systems, teams, leads, and operations -- remain the same."

**Section 5: Email Signup (on navy-800 background)**
- Wrap in a section element with class="bg-navy-800"
- SectionWrapper with width="narrow" and add id="signup" and class="text-center"
- h2 text-h2 mb-4 "Stay Ahead of the Curve"
- p text-body-lg text-text-secondary mb-8 max-w-xl mx-auto "Get actionable scaling insights delivered to your inbox. No spam, no fluff -- just frameworks that work."
- form with id="email-signup" and class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-3 max-w-md mx-auto"
  - FormInput with type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required={true} class="flex-1"
  - Button variant="primary" size="md" (no href -- renders as button) with text "Get Notified"
- p with id="form-message" class="text-sm mt-3 hidden" (empty -- JS populates)
- p with class="text-xs text-text-tertiary mt-4" text "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. We respect your inbox."

**Script tag at the bottom of the file (before closing Base tag):**
```
<script>
  function setupEmailForm() {
    const form = document.getElementById('email-signup') as HTMLFormElement;
    const message = document.getElementById('form-message') as HTMLElement;

    form?.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      const email = new FormData(form).get('email') as string;

      if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
        message.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address.';
        message.className = 'text-sm mt-3 text-error';
        message.classList.remove('hidden');
        return;
      }

      // Phase 4 will replace this with Kit API call
      message.textContent = "You're on the list! We'll be in touch.";
      message.className = 'text-sm mt-3 text-success';
      message.classList.remove('hidden');
      form.reset();
    });
  }

  setupEmailForm();
  document.addEventListener('astro:after-swap', setupEmailForm);
</script>
```

**Important details:**
- The form uses e.preventDefault() so the page does NOT reload on submit
- Email validation is basic: checks for presence and @ symbol. HTML5 type="email" + required handles the rest browser-natively
- Success message uses text-success (green), error uses text-error (red) -- both defined in global.css @theme
- The script runs setupEmailForm() immediately and also on astro:after-swap for View Transitions compatibility
- Phase 4 will replace the placeholder success logic with an actual Kit API fetch call
- The Button inside the form has NO href prop, so it renders as a button element (not anchor) -- this is critical for form submission
