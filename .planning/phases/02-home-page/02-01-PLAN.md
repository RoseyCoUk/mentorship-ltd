<objective>
Build the AccordionItem component and the top three sections of the home page: hero, problem, and solution.

Purpose: These sections are the first thing a visitor sees. The hero must immediately communicate what Elevateo offers and for whom. The problem section creates emotional resonance by naming specific pain points. The solution section positions Elevateo as the answer. Together they form the PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution) framework core.

Output: AccordionItem.astro component (used by Plan 02), and index.astro rewritten with hero, problem, and solution sections replacing all Phase 1 placeholder content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create AccordionItem.astro component</name>
  <files>src/components/AccordionItem.astro</files>
  <action>
Create a new AccordionItem.astro component at src/components/AccordionItem.astro.

Props interface:
- question: string (required) -- the FAQ question text displayed in the trigger button
- class?: string -- optional additional classes

Structure:
- Outer div with class "accordion-item border-b border-navy-700/50" and optional className
- A button element (NOT a div) with class "accordion-trigger", type="button", aria-expanded="false"
  - Contains a span with the question text
  - Contains an SVG chevron (down arrow) with class "accordion-icon", h-5 w-5, transition-transform duration-300
  - Button has flex, w-full, items-center, justify-between, py-5, text-left, text-body-lg, font-medium, text-white, hover:text-accent, transition-colors duration-200
- A content div with class "accordion-content overflow-hidden max-h-0 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out"
  - Inner div with pb-5 text-text-secondary containing a slot

Script tag (runs once, Astro deduplicates automatically):
- Function setupAccordions() that uses querySelectorAll('.accordion-trigger') (NOT getElementById -- Astro deduplicates scripts, so all instances must be targeted via class selector)
- On click: toggle aria-expanded between "true"/"false"
- When opening: set content.style.maxHeight = content.scrollHeight + 'px', add rotate-180 to icon
- When closing: set content.style.maxHeight = '0px', remove rotate-180 from icon
- Call setupAccordions() immediately
- Also listen for document 'astro:after-swap' event to re-setup (future-proofing for View Transitions)

Follow the exact pattern from 02-RESEARCH.md AccordionItem example. Use button elements for keyboard accessibility (focusable by default, responds to Enter/Space).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx astro check` -- no errors on the new component. Visually inspect the file has proper Props interface, button trigger with aria-expanded, script with querySelectorAll, and astro:after-swap listener.
  </verify>
  <done>AccordionItem.astro exists with button-based trigger, aria-expanded toggle, max-height animation, SVG chevron rotation, and class-based querySelectorAll in the script (not ID-based).</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite index.astro with Hero, Problem, and Solution sections</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace the ENTIRE content of src/pages/index.astro. The Phase 1 placeholder content is fully replaced. Import AccordionItem and FormInput at the top (they will be used by Plan 02, but importing now avoids a merge issue).

**Imports (frontmatter):**
- Base from "../layouts/Base.astro"
- SectionWrapper from "../components/SectionWrapper.astro"
- Button from "../components/Button.astro"
- Card from "../components/Card.astro"
- AccordionItem from "../components/AccordionItem.astro"
- FormInput from "../components/FormInput.astro"

**Section 1: Hero (on default navy-900 body background)**
- SectionWrapper with width="narrow" and class="pt-16 sm:pt-24 pb-12 sm:pb-16"
- Centered text (text-center)
- h1 with text-hero font-bold text-white mb-6: "Scale Past $1M Without Sacrificing Your Sanity" (with a br class="hidden sm:inline" after "Without" for responsive line break)
- p with text-body-lg text-text-secondary max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8: "Proven frameworks for established business owners who have hit a ceiling and need systems -- not more hustle -- to break through."
- Single Button: variant="primary" size="lg" href="#signup" with text "Start Scaling Today" (NOT two buttons like Phase 1 had -- research says one CTA per section)
- Trust line: p with text-sm text-text-tertiary mt-6, text "Join 2,000+ business owners already scaling with Elevateo" (placeholder number, updated when Alan provides real metrics)

**Section 2: Problem (on navy-950 background for contrast)**
- Wrap in a section element with class="bg-navy-950"
- SectionWrapper with width="wide" inside
- Centered headline area: h2 text-h2 mb-4 "The $1M Ceiling Is Real"
- Subtitle: p text-body-lg text-text-secondary max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-12 "Every growing business hits the same walls. Here is what is keeping you stuck."
- Grid: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6
- Three Card components, each with:
  1. Card 1: div with text-accent text-h2 mb-4 showing "01", h3 text-h3 mb-3 "Bottlenecked by You", p text-text-secondary "Every decision runs through you. Your business cannot grow past your personal capacity without the right systems in place."
  2. Card 2: "02", "Revenue Plateaus", "You have hit a ceiling. The tactics that got you to $500K will not get you to $1M. Scaling requires a fundamentally different playbook."
  3. Card 3: "03", "No Clear Roadmap", "Most business advice is for startups or Fortune 500s. There is a gap for established owners who need practical, proven frameworks to scale."

**Section 3: Solution (back to default navy-900 body background)**
- SectionWrapper with width="narrow"
- Centered text area: h2 text-h2 text-center mb-4 "Elevateo Gives You the Playbook"
- p text-body-lg text-text-secondary text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-10 "We built the frameworks, systems, and strategies that have helped business owners break through the $1M ceiling and scale with confidence."
- Checklist div (max-w-lg mx-auto space-y-4 mb-10) with 3 items, each as a flex items-start gap-3 div:
  - An accent-colored checkmark: svg with class="h-6 w-6 text-accent shrink-0 mt-1" using a check path (M5 13l4 4L19 7)
  - Text span with text-body-lg text-text-secondary:
    1. "Scalable systems that remove you as the bottleneck"
    2. "Proven frameworks to generate consistent leads and revenue"
    3. "Operational playbooks used by 7-figure business owners"
- Centered CTA: div text-center, Button variant="primary" size="md" href="#signup" "Get the Framework"

**After Section 3, leave a comment placeholder:**
```
<!-- FAQ Section (Plan 02) -->

<!-- Email Signup Section (Plan 02) -->
```

This tells Plan 02 exactly where to insert the remaining sections.

**Important anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use two CTA buttons in the hero (Phase 1 had two -- reduce to one)
- Do NOT use generic copy like "Grow Your Business" -- every headline and card names a specific pain point or outcome
- Do NOT put padding on the bg-navy-950 section element -- SectionWrapper handles padding internally via the .section class
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx astro build` -- build succeeds with zero errors. Open the dev server (`npx astro dev`) and verify in browser at http://localhost:4321:
1. Hero section displays with large headline, subheadline, single gold CTA button, and trust line
2. Problem section has darker background (navy-950) with 3 numbered cards
3. Solution section shows checklist with accent checkmarks and CTA
4. Sections are visually separated by background color differences
  </verify>
  <done>index.astro contains hero section with "Scale Past $1M" headline and single CTA, problem section with 3 numbered cards on navy-950 background, and solution section with checklist pattern and CTA. All placeholder Phase 1 content is removed. Build passes.</done>
