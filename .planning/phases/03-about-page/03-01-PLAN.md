<objective>
Fix the pre-existing FormInput.astro type error and restructure the about page founder story section to follow the three-beat narrative arc (empathy -> transformation -> mission).

Purpose: The FormInput type fix resolves a pre-existing `astro check` error that has been carried since Phase 1. The founder story restructure ensures the narrative follows the StoryBrand "Guide" pattern that builds trust by demonstrating empathy (shared experience) and authority (solved the problem). HTML comments mark each beat so the placeholder copy can be swapped for real content when Alan provides his narrative.

Output: FormInput.astro with narrowed type prop, about.astro with restructured founder story (three beats with HTML comments) and FormInput import added for Plan 02.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix FormInput.astro type prop and restructure about.astro founder story</name>
  <files>src/components/FormInput.astro, src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
**File 1: src/components/FormInput.astro**

Narrow the `type` prop from `string` to a union of supported input types. Replace the Props interface:

```typescript
interface Props {
  type?: "text" | "email" | "password" | "number" | "tel" | "url" | "search";
  name: string;
  placeholder?: string;
  required?: boolean;
  class?: string;
}
```

This is the ONLY change to FormInput.astro. Do not modify the template or styling. The union type prevents unsupported input types (like "file" or "range") that would look broken with the current dark-themed styling, and resolves the `astro check` type assignability error.

**File 2: src/pages/about.astro**

Make three targeted changes to the existing about.astro. Do NOT rewrite the entire file -- modify specific sections.

**Change 1: Add FormInput import**

Add `import FormInput from "../components/FormInput.astro";` after the existing Card import in the frontmatter. This import is needed by Plan 02 (email signup form). Adding it now avoids a merge conflict since both plans modify this file.

**Change 2: Rename founder section comment and add beat markers**

Change the comment `<!-- Founder Section -->` to `<!-- Founder Story Section (three-beat arc) -->`.

**Change 3: Restructure the three founder paragraphs with beat comments and updated copy**

Replace the existing `<!-- Founder Story -->` div (containing h2 "Alan Chan" and three paragraphs) with the three-beat arc structure. Keep the same h2 and the same div wrapper. The copy is enhanced to more explicitly follow the empathy -> transformation -> mission pattern:

```html
<!-- Founder Story (three beats) -->
<div>
  <h2 class="text-h2 mb-6">Alan Chan</h2>

  <!-- Beat 1: Empathy - "I was where you are" -->
  <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
    After spending years building and scaling businesses across multiple
    industries, Alan Chan hit the same wall that most established owners
    face: a revenue ceiling with no clear way through. He had the drive,
    the product, and the customers -- but the business could not grow
    past his personal capacity.
  </p>

  <!-- Beat 2: Transformation - "I figured out X" -->
  <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
    Through years of testing, failing, and refining, he built the
    operational frameworks that finally broke through that ceiling. Not
    theory from a textbook -- real systems forged in the trenches of
    actual business operations, from lead generation to team building
    to scalable offer creation.
  </p>

  <!-- Beat 3: Mission - "Now I help others do the same" -->
  <p class="text-text-secondary">
    That experience became the foundation of Elevateo Co. Today, Alan
    is focused on giving established owners the exact tools, frameworks,
    and systems they need to break through plateaus, build
    high-performing teams, and create businesses that scale without
    burning out.
  </p>
</div>
```

Key differences from existing copy:
- Beat 1: Changed from "founded Elevateo Co to solve the problem" to "hit the same wall" -- this makes Alan relatable (empathy) rather than immediately jumping to his solution
- Beat 2: Changed from "His approach is built on" to "Through years of testing, failing, and refining, he built" -- emphasizes the journey of discovery (transformation), not just the result
- Beat 3: Changed "Elevateo Co is focused on giving" to "That experience became the foundation of Elevateo Co. Today, Alan is focused on giving" -- connects personal journey to company mission
- HTML comments mark each beat for future copywriter reference

**What NOT to change:**
- Do NOT modify the hero section
- Do NOT modify the philosophy section
- Do NOT modify the photo placeholder Card
- Do NOT change the grid layout or column structure
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx astro check` -- should report no type errors on FormInput.astro (the type assignability error is resolved). The about.astro unused Button import warning may still appear (Button is imported but not used in a form yet -- Plan 02 fixes this). Verify the file has the three HTML beat comments by searching for "Beat 1", "Beat 2", "Beat 3" in about.astro.
  </verify>
  <done>FormInput.astro type prop narrowed from `string` to union type. about.astro founder story section restructured with three-beat arc (empathy, transformation, mission) marked by HTML comments. FormInput import added to about.astro frontmatter. `npx astro check` no longer reports FormInput type error.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npx astro check` reports no type errors on FormInput.astro
2. `npx astro build` completes with zero errors
3. about.astro contains `import FormInput` in frontmatter
4. about.astro contains three HTML comments: "Beat 1: Empathy", "Beat 2: Transformation", "Beat 3: Mission"
5. Founder story section comment updated to "three-beat arc"
6. Hero section unchanged
7. Philosophy section unchanged
8. Photo placeholder Card unchanged
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FormInput.astro type prop is a union type, not `string`
- about.astro founder story follows three-beat arc with HTML comment markers
- Both files build successfully with no type errors
- Existing page structure (hero, photo placeholder, philosophy) is preserved
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-about-page/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
