<objective>
Add the bg-navy-950 background to the philosophy section and add the email signup form to the about page, completing all three about page requirements (ABOUT-01, ABOUT-02, ABOUT-03).

Purpose: The philosophy section needs visual separation from the founder story via the navy-950 background (matching the home page pattern). The email signup form is the conversion goal of the about page -- after reading the founder's story and Elevateo's philosophy, the visitor has a clear action to take. The `id="signup"` ensures the header "Get Started" CTA works on the about page.

Output: about.astro updated with philosophy section wrapped in bg-navy-950 and email signup section with form, script, and success/error handling. The about page is complete.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Wrap philosophy section in bg-navy-950 and add email signup section</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
Open src/pages/about.astro (which Plan 01 has already updated with the three-beat founder story and FormInput import). Make two changes to complete the about page.

**Change 1: Wrap philosophy section in bg-navy-950**

The existing philosophy section uses SectionWrapper directly with no wrapping section element. Wrap it in `<section class="bg-navy-950">` to create visual separation from the founder story above.

Replace:
```html
  <!-- Philosophy Section -->
  <SectionWrapper width="narrow">
```

With:
```html
  <!-- Philosophy Section -->
  <section class="bg-navy-950">
    <SectionWrapper width="narrow">
```

And add the closing `</section>` tag after the existing `</SectionWrapper>` for the philosophy section. The closing should be:
```html
    </SectionWrapper>
  </section>
```

Do NOT change the philosophy content (h2, paragraphs). Only add the wrapping section element.

**Change 2: Add email signup section and script before closing Base tag**

Insert the email signup section AFTER the philosophy section's closing `</section>` tag and BEFORE the closing `</Base>` tag. Use slightly different copy from the home page to match the about page's personal tone (research recommends "Join the Journey" / "Stay Updated" for the about page context).

```html
  <!-- Email Signup Section -->
  <section class="bg-navy-800">
    <SectionWrapper width="narrow" id="signup" class="text-center">
      <h2 class="text-h2 mb-4">Join the Journey</h2>
      <p class="text-body-lg text-text-secondary mb-8 max-w-xl mx-auto">
        Get scaling insights from someone who has been in your shoes.
        No spam, no fluff -- just frameworks that work.
      </p>
      <form id="email-signup" class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-3 max-w-md mx-auto">
        <FormInput
          type="email"
          name="email"
          placeholder="Enter your email"
          required={true}
          class="flex-1"
        />
        <Button variant="primary" size="md">Stay Updated</Button>
      </form>
      <p id="form-message" class="text-sm mt-3 hidden"></p>
      <p class="text-xs text-text-tertiary mt-4">
        No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. We respect your inbox.
      </p>
    </SectionWrapper>
  </section>

  <script>
    function setupEmailForm() {
      const form = document.getElementById('email-signup') as HTMLFormElement;
      const message = document.getElementById('form-message') as HTMLElement;

      form?.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const email = new FormData(form).get('email') as string;

        if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
          message.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address.';
          message.className = 'text-sm mt-3 text-error';
          message.classList.remove('hidden');
          return;
        }

        // Phase 4 will replace this with Kit API call
        message.textContent = "You're on the list! We'll be in touch.";
        message.className = 'text-sm mt-3 text-success';
        message.classList.remove('hidden');
        form.reset();
      });
    }

    setupEmailForm();
    document.addEventListener('astro:after-swap', setupEmailForm);
  </script>
```

**Important details:**
- The `id="signup"` on SectionWrapper ensures the header "Get Started" button works on the about page (it links to #signup)
- Same form IDs as index.astro (#email-signup, #form-message) -- no collision because Astro generates separate HTML documents
- Button has NO href prop so it renders as a `<button>` element (not anchor) -- critical for form submission
- The script uses the exact same setupEmailForm pattern as index.astro for consistency and to simplify Phase 4's Kit API refactor
- The script re-runs on astro:after-swap for View Transitions compatibility
- Copy differences from home page: "Join the Journey" heading (vs "Stay Ahead of the Curve"), "Stay Updated" button (vs "Get Notified"), and subheadline references "someone who has been in your shoes" to connect to the founder story

**What NOT to change:**
- Do NOT modify the hero section
- Do NOT modify the founder story section (Plan 01's work)
- Do NOT modify the philosophy section content (only add the wrapping section element)

Run `npx astro build` -- build succeeds with zero errors. Run `npx astro check` -- no type errors (FormInput type fixed in Plan 01, Button import now used). Open dev server (`npx astro dev`) and verify at http://localhost:4321/about:
1. Philosophy section has darker background (navy-950) creating visual break from founder story
2. Email signup form visible below philosophy section on navy-800 background
3. Submitting empty form shows red error message
4. Submitting valid email shows green success message
5. Page does NOT reload on form submit

4. PHILOSOPHY: Verify "What Makes Us Different" section has a visibly darker background than the sections above and below it
5. PHILOSOPHY CONTENT: Verify three paragraphs about established owners, specific scaling levers ($500K-$5M), and "no fluff" differentiator
6. EMAIL FORM: Enter a valid email and click "Stay Updated" -- verify green success message
7. EMAIL ERROR: Clear the field and submit -- verify red error message
8. EMAIL NO RELOAD: Confirm page does NOT reload on submission
