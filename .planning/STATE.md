Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Alan must provide professional photography, 2-3 verifiable metrics, and founder story narrative before Phase 2 content can be finalized
- Course topic definitions with enough depth needed before Phase 4 (vague placeholders hurt credibility)
- Brand identity specifics (accent color, typography choices) needed before Phase 1 design token system
