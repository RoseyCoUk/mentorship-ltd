## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Astro 5.x + Tailwind CSS 4.x + GSAP + Kit (ConvertKit) + Cloudflare Pages stack per research
- [Roadmap]: Email integration consolidated into Phase 4 (Kit API + form states finalized with courses page)
- [Roadmap]: GSAP animations deferred to Phase 5 (can't animate pages that don't exist)
- [01-01]: Gold (#D4A843) selected as accent color for premium authority feel
- [01-01]: Inter Variable as single font for heading + body (performance + readability)
- [01-01]: Reset default Tailwind colors to enforce brand-only palette
- [01-01]: CSS-first Tailwind v4 with @theme directive -- no tailwind.config.js
- [01-02]: Header spacer div for fixed header offset (not body padding-top)
- [01-02]: Button dynamic Tag renders as <a> or <button> based on href prop
- [01-02]: Footer social links are placeholder text (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube) until real URLs provided
- [01-03]: All page content is placeholder -- real copy deferred to Phases 2-4
- [01-03]: Course "Coming Soon" badges as styled inline elements
- [01-03]: Founder photo placeholder box (not actual image) until photography provided

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Alan must provide professional photography, 2-3 verifiable metrics, and founder story narrative before Phase 2 content can be finalized
- Course topic definitions with enough depth needed before Phase 4 (vague placeholders hurt credibility)
