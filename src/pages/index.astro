  <!-- FAQ Section -->
  <SectionWrapper width="narrow">
    <h2 class="text-h2 text-center mb-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div>
      <AccordionItem question="Who is Elevateo for?">
        <p>Elevateo is built for established business owners already generating revenue who want to scale past $500K-$1M+. If you are just getting started, this is not the right fit -- we focus on scaling systems, not startup tactics.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem question="How is this different from other business coaching?">
        <p>Most coaching is generic motivation or theory. Elevateo provides specific, proven frameworks for operational scaling -- the systems, team structures, and processes that actually move the needle past seven figures.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem question="Do I need to be at a certain revenue level?">
        <p>Our frameworks are designed for businesses generating at least $250K+ in annual revenue. At this stage, you have product-market fit and need to focus on systems, teams, and scalable operations -- which is exactly what we teach.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem question="What kind of results can I expect?">
        <p>Results vary by business, but our frameworks focus on three outcomes: removing yourself as the bottleneck, building repeatable revenue systems, and creating operational clarity. Most owners see meaningful progress within 90 days of implementation.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem question="Is this a course, coaching, or community?">
        <p>Elevateo is building a library of focused video courses on specific scaling challenges. Each course is designed to be actionable -- not theory you will never use. Coaching and community may be added in the future based on demand.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem question="What if this does not work for my industry?">
        <p>The frameworks we teach are industry-agnostic. Whether you run a service business, e-commerce store, or SaaS product, the fundamentals of scaling -- systems, teams, leads, and operations -- remain the same.</p>
