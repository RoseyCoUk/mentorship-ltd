    <p class="text-body-lg text-text-secondary text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      Elevateo Co was built on one belief: every established business owner deserves a clear path to scale, not guesswork and generic advice.

        <!-- Beat 1: Empathy - "I was where you are" -->
        <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
          After spending years building and scaling businesses across multiple
          industries, Alan Chan hit the same wall that most established owners
          face: a revenue ceiling with no clear way through. He had the drive,
          the product, and the customers -- but the business could not grow
          past his personal capacity.
        </p>

        <!-- Beat 2: Transformation - "I figured out X" -->
        <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
          Through years of testing, failing, and refining, he built the
          operational frameworks that finally broke through that ceiling. Not
          theory from a textbook -- real systems forged in the trenches of
          actual business operations, from lead generation to team building
          to scalable offer creation.
        </p>

        <!-- Beat 3: Mission - "Now I help others do the same" -->
        <p class="text-text-secondary">
          That experience became the foundation of Elevateo Co. Today, Alan
          is focused on giving established owners the exact tools, frameworks,
          and systems they need to break through plateaus, build
          high-performing teams, and create businesses that scale without
          burning out.

      <h2 class="text-h2 mb-6">What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
        Most business education is built for people just getting started. Elevateo is built for owners who already have revenue, already have customers, and already know the basics. The challenge at your stage is not learning how to start. It is learning how to scale.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary mb-4">
        We focus on the specific levers that matter between $500K and $5M: scalable offer design, repeatable lead generation systems, sales processes that do not depend on the founder, and operational frameworks that free you from day-to-day execution.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text-secondary">
        No fluff, no generic motivation, no one-size-fits-all playbooks. Just proven systems tailored to established business owners who are ready to grow.
